### Stage 2/6: Negative Photo

Ok. fun. Actually doing stuff with images again. Having to handle parameters. Fun stuff.

I ran into a silly issue with this. IDEA said there was no `main` found. It's because I had used `fun main(args: List<String>)` instead of `fun main(args: Array<String>)`

Oops! Other than that though, Easy enough.

### Stage 1/6: Create an image

This was the usual Stage 1 simple setup. "Create a program that does very little towards the intended goal of the project."

It was a nice refresher with working with BufferedImage and ImageIO, which I hadn't touched in a few weeks.
