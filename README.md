# Hyperskill_Kotlin_Seam Carving

This is the 8th project I am completing as part of Jetbrain Academy's Kotlin course, and the 1st under the "Kotlin Developer" course.

It is rated as a challenging difficulty project. The goal is to make a seam carving tool to process and compress images.

I have included the tests that Hyperskill uses to determine if a project is complete.
